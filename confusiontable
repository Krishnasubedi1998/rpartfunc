  To make a prediction using the tree we have created, we pass predict the tree we have created and the dataset we want it to work on.

pred <- predict(tree, df, type = "class")
head(pred)
##        1        2        3        4        5        6 
## offshore offshore  on land offshore offshore offshore 
## Levels: offshore on land
Each has been classified into its category. You can also recover the probabilities of the classification by dropping the type = “class”

predict(tree, df) %>%
  head()
##     offshore   on land
## 1 0.94000000 0.0600000
## 2 0.94000000 0.0600000
## 3 0.02173913 0.9782609
## 4 0.94000000 0.0600000
## 5 0.94000000 0.0600000
## 6 0.94000000 0.0600000
We see that the first earthquake has a 93% shot of being offshore.

Confusion table follows by using the classified data.

confusion_table <- with(df, table(Offshore, pred))
confusion_table
##           pred
## Offshore   offshore on land
##   offshore       94       3
##   on land         6      54
I will now examine what happens if I withhold some of the data and do a cross validation. I split the data into thirds for testing and training.

library(caret)
## Loading required package: lattice
## 
## Attaching package: 'caret'
## The following object is masked from 'package:purrr':
## 
##     lift
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y = df$Month, p = .66, list = FALSE)
df_train <- df %>% slice(inTrain)
df_test <- df %>% slice(-inTrain)
dim(df_train)
## [1] 108   9
dim(df_test)
## [1] 49  9
I will use the training set to build my model and then test it. If you look at my original tree, the country is very important. I am going to remove it from my tree and not allow that to be part of the decision tree (it was causing hell in me creating a tree!).

tree_from_train <- rpart(Offshore ~.,data = subset(df_train, select=c( -Country)))
pred_test <- predict(tree_from_train, subset(df_test, select=c( -Country)), type = "class")
with(df_test, table(Offshore, pred_test))
##           pred_test
## Offshore   offshore on land
##   offshore       24       2
##   on land         2      21
